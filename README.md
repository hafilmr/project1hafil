============================================================
This project is the result of hard work for a final project at university. This project is a sentiment analysis research based on data from twitter.

The data obtained is then carried out by a preprocessing process, the results of the preprocessing are continued with lexicon based labeling. Then, using the TF-IDF method for the weighting process, followed by a grid search for the hyperparameter tuning process. The algorithm used is SVM to get accuracy results.
